# How to run the server in local network

Follow instructions from [official Jekyll documentations](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements)

* Install Ruby [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* Run `gem install jekyll bundler` on terminal
* Run following commands on terminal with this project directory as cwd
    * `bundle install` (only once)
    * `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --drafts` (everytime you want to start the server)
* Now that the server is running, you can open a web browser and connect to `http://localhost:4000`
