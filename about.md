## Languages

I'm fluent in **Korean**.
For **English**, reading and writing are ok but speaking and listening are not.

## Things I do

Interested in working on a game engine that can run on both Windows and Android.
Naming some, there is [one that uses OpenGL](https://github.com/SausageTaste/Little-Ruler) and [the other that uses Vulkan](https://github.com/SausageTaste/Dalbaragi).
