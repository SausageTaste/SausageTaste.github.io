It's been awhile since I last wrote a blog on computer graphics.
Ever since I graduated from university, it's been a tough time finding a job and getting used to the new routine.
Now that I'm settled and feel stable, I'll start writing again!

Recently I've been working on a cool stuff.
A new Vulkan rendering engine project [mirinae](https://github.com/SausageTaste/mirinae) is here, and [Dalbaragi Engine](https://github.com/SausageTaste/dalbaragi) has become history.
Yeah it was total rewrite and I think it was worth it.

Check out some visuals.
