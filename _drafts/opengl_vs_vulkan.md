Among gamers, Vulkan is viewed as a blazingly fast but highly complex tool that is used to make games.
That's not entirely wrong.
But many of them, especially Android phone gamers, have misconception that simply switching form OpenGL ES to Vulkan would improve their game's framerate magically, which is not true.

I had started learning OpenGL in 2017 with [this project](https://github.com/SausageTaste/practiceOpenGL-FirstPerson), and switched to Vulkan in 2020 with [this project](https://github.com/SausageTaste/practiceOpenGL-FirstPerson).
I have accumulated enough experience with both APIs, thus I might be able to write a post that thoroughly explains their differences, in a more technical and tangible way.
