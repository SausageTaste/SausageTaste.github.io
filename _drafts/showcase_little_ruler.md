# How I started programming

It's been like 6 years since I started game engine programming.
I started it by learning PyGame and PyOpenGL.
I remember in those days I spent weeks to figure out how to draw a simple rectangle.
I was so excited when I finally managed to draw a rectangle with a bitmap texture on it.

I had a lot of fun with Python and OpenGL.
Check out my 2 Python projects on my GitHub profile.
[This](https://github.com/SausageTaste/practiceOpenGL-FirstPerson) and [this](https://github.com/SausageTaste/escapeRoom).
Epscially about the latter one, I'm kinda proud of it.
It has a basic map loading system, and a console panel.

While I enjoyed programming in Python, I startetd think, I might as well try C++.
Because that's the de facto standard programming language in game development world.

Before that, I was just a university student who majors economics.
My degree had nothing to do with software development.
But ever since I started to dig in C++, my dream have gotten to be a serious software engineer.

# What is this project

It is a cross platform game engine.
It supports Windows, Linux, and Android.
It's written in C++, using OpenGL for rendering,

This is my first project that the number of code lines exceeded 20,000.
The program architecture might not so beautiful and the performance is pretty bad, espacially on Android devices.
But I'm certain I've learned a lot of stuff while working on this project.
This post is summarizing it.
