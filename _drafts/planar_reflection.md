Reflection is beautiful.
Water surface so bright with sunshine breaking it into fragments.

Think about the RTX hype among core gamers.
They were excited how the new technology could vastly improve reflections.
Rifle body reflecting animated flames and glasses that reflects dynamic objects.
They were nothing but just eye candies, but we all loved it and I still do.

Reflection with ray tracing is perfect but with cost.
RTX graphic cards are expensive, and even with it, it's hard to maintain ok framerate.

Now look at this.

> Half Life 2 water demonstration

This game was released in 2004 and the reflection is just awesome.
It can't be that Valve in the past somehow managed to implement ray tracing reflection that can run on old potato machines.

While the water refleciton is nearly perfect, it is rather embarassing to see other materials with shininess.
Look at the tile floor.
The reflection is not even accurately positioned on the floor.
The reflection image follows your view, just like how moon always stays same spot on the sky dome.

Why didn't they just use the same reflection techonoly for the floor?
It seems the way Valve implemented it's water reflection, has some kind of limitations.
We will study how this kind of reflections were implemented, and learn why the technology is not used these days.

Let's dig in to the world of *Planar Reflection*

# Variety examples of planar reflections

Along with Half-Life 2, there are many other games that uses this technique.

This is from Grand Theft Auto V.
You can find mirrors with perfect reflections in cloth stores arorund Los Santos.
