Reflection is beautiful.
Water surface so bright with sunshine breaking it into fragments.

Think about the RTX hype among core gamers.
They were excited how the new technology could vastly improve reflections.
Rifle body reflecting animated flames and glasses that reflects dynamic objects.
They were nothing but just eye candies, but we all loved it and I still do.

Reflection with ray tracing is perfect but with cost.
RTX graphic cards are expensive, and even with it, it's hard to maintain ok framerate.

This game was released in 2004 and the reflection is just awesome.
It can't be that Valve in the past somehow managed to implement ray tracing reflection that can run on old potato machines.

We will study how this kind of reflections were implemented, and learn why the technology is not used these days.
